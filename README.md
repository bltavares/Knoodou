#About it

I would'n say to put it on an production enviroment. This is the result of a two-week to be delivered at school.
It wasn't allowed to use EF or any other tool. Only pure code.

But it got really awesome. It has the Did you mean it? for movie names, it learn with the constumer's location to sugest movies, it integrate with Twitter, email *AND* Facebook.

It's not a beutifull code, but is working. Hope I got some time in the future to make it better.
